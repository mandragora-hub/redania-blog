Sometime we need to cast string into boolean but with got some unexpected behavior in javascript and typescript. For example suppose that you have a environment variable in .env.

```env title=".env"
ENABLE_SOME_CONDITIONALLY=true
```

```ts title="index.ts"

```


```ts 
const booleanify = (value: string): boolean => {
  const truthy: string[] = ['true', 'True', '1'];

  return truthy.includes(value);
};

export default booleanify;
```
