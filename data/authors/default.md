My name's Royer Gomez. I'm a sofware engineer based in Santo Domingo ☀️. I am an enthusiastic open source developer. I write code for web platforms and embedded devices following good practice principles. ❤️.

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my blog.

In my free time you can find me longboarding 🛹 , at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, at the beach 🏖 or on tech meetups and conferences around Barcelona and Europe 🗺
